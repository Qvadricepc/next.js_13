## Getting Started

The project uses: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation

I've created select component so now we can create as many filters as we want.
Pagination implemented but limited by the api to get only 20 characters, so layout depends on the amount of the cards
Pagination also may be improved by remembering where user was before he entered the card, for now it sets user to the 1 page
Layout is also may be improved for your own taste, for now it's more like schema

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
